<p>A simple solver for the very fun game called 3d logic 
<a href="http://mypuzzle.org/3d-logic">http://mypuzzle.org/3d-logic</a></p>

<p>Right now it only supports 3x3 matrix (fast) or 5x5 matrix with Bruteforce (slow!)
The only algorithm right now is the brute force solver. 
Here's how the solver works</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the puzzle from the file. A puzzle is made of 3 matrices (3x3 matrices for 3x3 puzzles and ...)</li>
<li>Read a graph.txt file that describes how to make the puzzle into a graph. It's the easiest way I found to do this without too much code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a few notes on how the solver works.
First, the graph is made without including the "walls". They are discarded at the graph reading stage actually.
When a graph of the puzzle is made, the following data structures are available :</p>

<ul>
<li>A vector of cells</li>
<li>A graph of these cells</li>
</ul>

<p>The graph of the cells is used by the Verification algorithm.
The verification algorithm is a recursive graph search algorithm done for each color. If each color checks out, then the cube is correct.
Maybe a better faster verification can be done! Work to be done here.</p>

<p>The only solver available right now is a brute force solver.</p>

<ul>
<li>A list of the "mutable" cells is made from the whole list of cells</li>
<li>A short recursive function goes through this list and tries all the colors. Complexity for a 6 mutable cells with 4 color problem is 4^6
You can see how for big 5x5 or 6x6 cubes this approach will not work :)</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all for now!</p>
